-- Write a solution to find the cancellation rate of requests with unbanned users (both client and driver must not be banned) each day between "2013-10-01" and "2013-10-03" with at least one trip. Round Cancellation Rate to two decimal points.

# Write your MySQL query statement below
SELECT 
    t.request_at AS Day,
    ROUND(
        SUM(CASE WHEN t.status != 'completed' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) / COUNT(*),
        2
    ) AS 'Cancellation Rate'
FROM Trips t
JOIN Users c 
    ON t.client_id = c.users_id AND c.banned = 'No'
JOIN Users d 
    ON t.driver_id = d.users_id AND d.banned = 'No'
WHERE t.request_at BETWEEN '2013-10-01' AND '2013-10-03'
GROUP BY t.request_at;
